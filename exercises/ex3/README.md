## Task: Confirm Systems

The next task is the **Confirm System Components** task. In this task, we will confirm the system/tenant details that will be used to set up the integration scenario. You need to select the destination (**CI: Cloud Integration Destination**) for the **SAP Cloud Integration tenant** as shown in the image below. Once that is done, click on **Confirm Systems** as shown in the above diagram.

## Task: Assign Users to required Roles

The next task is the **Assign Users to required Roles** task. In this task, you will assign the user to the roles that are required by the workflow. In the productive scenario, these users may be different. For example, in a customer environment, the BTP Administrator might be different from the S/4 Administrator. But for the hands-on session, kindly assign your user to all the roles.

<ins>**NOTE:** Click on the **Assign all roles to my user** as shown below and proceed to the next task by clicking **Confirm Role Assignment**.</ins>
